Starting your first aquarium is an exciting journey into the underwater world. With proper planning and setup, you'll create a thriving aquatic ecosystem that brings joy for years to come. This comprehensive guide walks you through every step of the process.

## Why Planning Matters

Many beginners rush to add fish immediately, leading to frustration and fish loss. Success requires patience and understanding of the nitrogen cycle. Follow this guide step-by-step, and you'll avoid common pitfalls that plague new aquarists.

## Step 1: Choosing Your Tank

### Tank Size Recommendations

Bigger is always better in fishkeeping. Larger volumes of water are more stable and forgiving of mistakes.

**Recommended sizes for beginners:**
- **Minimum**: 40L (10 gallons) - Small but manageable
- **Ideal**: 80-120L (20-30 gallons) - Perfect balance
- **Advanced**: 200L+ (50+ gallons) - Maximum stability

**Why avoid small tanks?**
- Water parameters change rapidly
- Limited stocking options
- Harder to maintain stable temperature
- Waste accumulates quickly

### Tank Location

Choose your location carefully—moving a filled tank is nearly impossible!

**Ideal location criteria:**
- Strong, level surface (use a proper aquarium stand)
- Away from direct sunlight (causes algae blooms)
- Away from heating/cooling vents
- Near electrical outlets
- Away from high-traffic areas
- Level floor (use a level to check)

**Weight consideration**: A filled 100L tank weighs approximately 120kg (tank + water + equipment). Ensure your floor and stand can support this weight.

## Step 2: Essential Equipment Checklist

Before setup, gather all necessary equipment. Don't skip items—each plays a crucial role.

### Must-Have Equipment

- [ ] **Filter** - Mechanical and biological filtration
- [ ] **Heater** - Maintains stable temperature (for tropical fish)
- [ ] **Thermometer** - Monitors water temperature
- [ ] **Light** - For viewing and plant growth
- [ ] **Substrate** - Gravel or sand (2-3 inches depth)
- [ ] **Water conditioner** - Removes chlorine and chloramine
- [ ] **Test kit** - Measures ammonia, nitrite, nitrate, pH
- [ ] **Net** - For catching fish
- [ ] **Bucket** - Dedicated to aquarium use only
- [ ] **Air pump** (optional) - Provides additional oxygenation

### Equipment Sizing

**Filter**: Use our [filter calculator](/calculators?tab=filter) to determine required flow rate. General rule: 4-10x tank volume per hour.

**Heater**: Use our [heater calculator](/calculators?tab=heater) for precise wattage. General rule: 3-5 watts per gallon (or 1 watt per liter).

**Lighting**: For fish-only tanks, any aquarium light works. For planted tanks, choose appropriate spectrum and intensity.

## Step 3: Setting Up the Tank

Now the fun begins! Follow these steps carefully.

### Physical Setup

1. **Clean everything** - Rinse tank, substrate, and decorations with water only (no soap!)
2. **Position the tank** - Place on stand, ensure level
3. **Add substrate** - Rinse thoroughly, add 2-3 inches to tank
4. **Arrange hardscape** - Position rocks and driftwood
5. **Install equipment** - Place filter, heater, thermometer
6. **Add decorations** - Plants, caves, ornaments

### Filling the Tank

**Pro tip**: Place a plate or bowl on substrate before filling to avoid disturbing the layout.

1. Fill tank 3/4 full with tap water
2. Add water conditioner (dose for full volume)
3. Fill to final level (leave 2-3cm from top)
4. Turn on filter and heater
5. Wait 24 hours for temperature to stabilize

## Step 4: The Nitrogen Cycle (CRITICAL!)

This is the most important concept in fishkeeping. Understanding the cycle is the difference between success and failure.

### What is the Nitrogen Cycle?

Fish produce ammonia (NH₃) through waste and respiration. Ammonia is highly toxic. Beneficial bacteria convert ammonia to nitrite (NO₂), also toxic. Different bacteria convert nitrite to nitrate (NO₃), which is much less harmful.

**The cycle**: Fish Waste → Ammonia → Nitrite → Nitrate

### Cycling Methods

#### Fishless Cycling (RECOMMENDED)

Add ammonia source without fish present. This is the humane, safe method.

**Method 1: Pure Ammonia**
- Add pure ammonia (no additives) to reach 2-4 ppm
- Test daily
- Add more ammonia when it drops to 0
- Cycle is complete when ammonia and nitrite both reach 0 within 24 hours
- Duration: 4-6 weeks

**Method 2: Fish Food**
- Add pinch of fish food daily
- Food decomposes, producing ammonia
- Less precise but simpler
- Duration: 6-8 weeks

#### Fish-In Cycling (Not Recommended)

Adding hardy fish immediately exposes them to toxic conditions. Only use if absolutely necessary, with frequent water changes (50% daily).

### Cycling Timeline

| Week | Ammonia | Nitrite | Nitrate | Action |
|------|---------|---------|---------|--------|
| 1-2 | Rising | 0 | 0 | Continue adding ammonia |
| 2-3 | Dropping | Rising | Low | Continue monitoring |
| 3-4 | 0 | Dropping | Rising | Almost done! |
| 4-6 | 0 | 0 | Present | CYCLED! Do 50% water change |

## Step 5: Understanding Water Parameters

Regular testing ensures a healthy environment. Invest in a quality test kit—strips are convenient, liquid kits are more accurate.

### Ideal Parameters for Most Tropical Fish

| Parameter | Ideal Range | Danger Zone |
|-----------|-------------|-------------|
| **Ammonia (NH₃)** | 0 ppm | >0.25 ppm |
| **Nitrite (NO₂)** | 0 ppm | >0.25 ppm |
| **Nitrate (NO₃)** | <20 ppm | >40 ppm |
| **pH** | 6.5-7.5 | <6.0 or >8.0 |
| **Temperature** | 24-26°C | <20°C or >30°C |
| **KH (Carbonate Hardness)** | 4-8 dKH | <2 dKH |
| **GH (General Hardness)** | 4-12 dGH | Varies by species |

### Testing Schedule

**During cycling**: Daily (ammonia, nitrite, nitrate)
**First month**: Every 3 days
**After established**: Weekly
**After water changes**: Within 24 hours

## Step 6: Adding Your First Fish

Your tank is cycled! Now the moment you've been waiting for.

### Acclimation Process

Never dump fish directly into your tank! Sudden parameter changes cause shock and death.

**Temperature acclimation:**
1. Float sealed bag in tank for 15-20 minutes
2. Water temperatures equalize

**Drip acclimation (recommended):**
1. Pour fish and bag water into bucket
2. Set up airline tubing as siphon from tank to bucket
3. Tie knot in tubing to create slow drip (2-3 drips per second)
4. Let drip for 30-60 minutes (doubles water volume)
5. Net fish into tank (discard bag water)

### Stocking Strategy

**Week 1**: Add 3-5 hardy fish
- Zebra Danios
- Platies
- Corydoras

**Week 2-3**: Wait and monitor parameters

**Week 4**: Add next group (3-5 fish)

**Week 6+**: Complete stocking gradually

**Never**: Add all fish at once! Your biological filtration needs time to adjust to increased bioload.

### Beginner-Friendly First Fish

Start with these hardy species that tolerate cycling fluctuations:

1. **Zebra Danios** - Extremely hardy, active
2. **Platies** - Colorful, peaceful, easy
3. **Corydoras Catfish** - Peaceful bottom-dwellers
4. **Cherry Barbs** - Hardy schooling fish

## Step 7: Feeding Your Fish

Overfeeding is the #1 mistake beginners make. It pollutes water and kills fish.

### Feeding Guidelines

**Amount**: Only what fish consume in 2-3 minutes
**Frequency**: Once daily for adults, twice for juveniles
**Variety**: Rotate between flakes, pellets, frozen, and live food
**Fasting**: Skip one day per week (reduces waste buildup)

**Signs of overfeeding:**
- Cloudy water
- Elevated nitrates
- Food debris on bottom
- Algae blooms

## Step 8: Maintenance Schedule

Consistency is key to long-term success.

### Daily Tasks (2 minutes)
- Visual check: count fish, observe behavior
- Check temperature
- Feed fish (once daily)

### Weekly Tasks (30 minutes)
- 25-30% water change
- Vacuum substrate (gravel vacuum)
- Clean algae from glass
- Test water parameters
- Check equipment function

### Monthly Tasks (60 minutes)
- Clean filter media (rinse in old tank water)
- Trim plants
- Replace chemical filter media (carbon, etc.)
- Deep clean decorations if needed
- Check equipment for wear

### Quarterly Tasks
- Replace filter cartridges (if applicable)
- Deep clean equipment
- Inspect for leaks or damage
- Update stocking plans

## Common Beginner Mistakes to Avoid

### 1. Adding Fish Too Soon
**Problem**: Ammonia spike kills fish
**Solution**: Complete full 4-6 week cycle

### 2. Overfeeding
**Problem**: Water pollution, algae, sick fish
**Solution**: Feed only what's consumed in 2-3 minutes

### 3. Inadequate Filtration
**Problem**: Poor water quality, frequent issues
**Solution**: Use filter rated for 1.5-2x your tank volume

### 4. Neglecting Water Changes
**Problem**: Nitrate accumulation, stressed fish
**Solution**: 25-30% weekly, non-negotiable

### 5. Incompatible Fish
**Problem**: Aggression, stress, death
**Solution**: Research compatibility before buying

### 6. Overstocking
**Problem**: Poor water quality, stunted growth, aggression
**Solution**: Follow stocking guidelines, less is more

### 7. Skipping Quarantine
**Problem**: Disease spreads to entire tank
**Solution**: Quarantine new fish for 2-4 weeks (if possible)

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Cloudy Water

**Bacterial bloom** (whitish): Normal during cycling, clears in 2-3 days

**Green water**: Algae bloom, reduce light, increase water changes

**Brown water**: Excess tannins from driftwood, harmless but do water changes

### High Ammonia/Nitrite

- Stop feeding immediately
- 50% water change daily
- Add beneficial bacteria supplement
- Check filter is running properly

### Fish Gasping at Surface

- Check ammonia/nitrite (probably high)
- Increase surface agitation
- Add air stone
- Do immediate 50% water change
